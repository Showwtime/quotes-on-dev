#Description: 
For Project 5, we combined our JavaScript and WordPress     skills together to build out the functionality for a        website called Quotes on Dev using the WordPress REST API.  Used to fetch coding quotes from a REST API at the touch of a button. Aswell as a submit form to input new quotes into the database.

#Technologies Used: 
We used a starter pack for WordPress to get the base files. We also used PHP, Javascript(jQuery), and Gulp to modify and style the site to reflect the vision of the design examples.
